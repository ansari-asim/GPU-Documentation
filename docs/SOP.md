**Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for GPU Installation and Maintenance**

### Environment Setup for GPU Installation

**Designated Area**

- **A)** Ensure the GPU and device are placed in a neat and clean environment to remain dust-free.
- **B)** If such an environment is unavailable, install a rack system.

**Rack Requirements**

- **Water-Resistant and Dust-Proof Racks:**

  - For **Jetson Devices**: Use a **2U rack**.
  - For **RTX GPUs**: Use a **12U rack**.

**Power Requirements & Socket Specifications**

- For **Jetson Devices**: Requires a **5 Amp socket**.
- For **RTX GPUs**: Requires a **16 Amp socket**.

### GPU Installation Process

**Power Down and Open Case**

1. Shut down the computer and unplug it from the wall.
2. Press the power button for a few seconds to discharge any remaining electricity.
3. Open the case by unscrewing or releasing the side panel.

**Identify PCIe Slot**

- Locate the primary PCIe x16 slot (usually the top slot closest to the CPU).

**Prepare the Case**

- Remove the expansion slot covers on the case corresponding to the GPU.

**Insert the GPU**

1. Line up the GPUâ€™s PCIe connector with the slot.
2. Gently press down until you hear a click from the retention clip.
3. Secure the GPU bracket to the case using screws.

**Connect Power Cables**

- Connect the PCIe power cables from the PSU to the GPU (6-pin, 8-pin, or both, depending on the GPU).
- Ensure the connections are firm and secure.

**Close the Case and Power Up**

1. Replace the side panel and screw it back into place.
2. Plug the system back into the wall and power it on.

###Servicing and Maintenance

**Service Frequency**

- Devices must be serviced **every 3 months** to ensure optimal performance and longevity.

**Steps for Servicing**

1. Cabinet Cleaning
    - Use a soft fabric or tissue to clean the cabinet exterior and interior.
    - Remove any accumulated dust or dirt.

2. Dust Removal
    - Use a blower to clean the machine thoroughly, including all visible and hidden areas.

3. RAM Cleaning
    - Remove the RAM modules carefully.
    - Inspect for any carbon deposits or residue.
    - If carbon is detected, clean the contacts gently using a rubber eraser.

4. GPU Cleaning
    - Detach the GPU from the motherboard carefully.
    - Check for carbon deposits or residue on the GPU contacts.
    - Clean the contacts gently using a rubber eraser.

5. Fan Cleaning
    - Use a blower to clean the fans thoroughly.
    - Ensure no dust or debris remains.

6. Fan Net Cleaning
    - Clean the fan nets using a combination of a blower and soft fabric.
    - Ensure the nets are free of any blockages.

**Additional Checks During Servicing**

- Inspect the power sockets and connectors for wear and tear.
- Ensure all screws and fittings in the racks are securely fastened.
- Verify that the fans are running smoothly without noise or obstruction.

**Notes**

- Always handle components with care to avoid static damage.
- Ensure proper ventilation during installation and servicing to avoid overheating.
